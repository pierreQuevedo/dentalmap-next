/**
 * Seven timing/character tiers, not seven speeds.
 *
 * - fast: micro-feedback: toggles, checkboxes, single-step surface lifts.
 * - moderate: dropdowns, tabs, drawers, select menus, and merged-selection
 *   backgrounds — panels that have to settle precisely where they were aimed.
 * - slow: dialogs, sheets, and anything travelling far enough that a little
 *   overshoot reads as alive rather than sluggish.
 * - snappy: zero-latency follow. A dragged sheet, a magnetic button, an element
 *   tracking the cursor — motion that must feel like a direct response to the
 *   hand, not a panel arriving. Bounce is 0 and the visual duration is shorter
 *   than `fast`, because any overshoot on something the user is actively moving
 *   reads as lag. Never reached through motionForOffset.
 * - gentle: ambient, unhurried motion — a backdrop fading up, a hero settling on
 *   load, a section easing in as it scrolls into view. Longer and calmer than
 *   `slow`, with barely any bounce, so it recedes instead of announcing itself.
 *   Never reached through motionForOffset.
 * - morph: shape, not distance. For a `layout` animation where width, height
 *   and border-radius change together — the element becoming a different
 *   thing, rather than the same thing arriving. The other tiers are calibrated
 *   for a panel translating a few pixels while it fades; a box crossing 200px
 *   of width at those timings reads as a snap. Bounce stays low for the same
 *   reason: overshoot on a large dimension change reads as unstable rather
 *   than alive. Like playful, it is never reached through motionForOffset.
 * - playful: a character tier, not a speed. The bounce (0.42) is loud on
 *   purpose, for the one-off moment worth celebrating: a deploy that finished,
 *   a goal that was hit. It is never reached through motionForOffset — a
 *   component opts into it by hand, so no ordinary overlay turns festive by
 *   accident.
 *
 * ## Why `visualDuration` and not `duration`
 *
 * A spring's `duration` covers the whole animation *including* the settling
 * tail, and the tail is the part nobody perceives as travel. Calibrating on it
 * means every tier lands visually earlier than its own number claims — so a
 * scale that reads as reasonable in the source is systematically faster than
 * that on screen, and the discrepancy grows with bounce.
 *
 * `visualDuration` is the time to visual arrival, with the tail falling after
 * it. It is the number a reader's eye actually experiences, which makes it the
 * only one of the two worth tuning by feel. It also composes with time-based
 * animations: the CSS custom properties a dozen components derive from these
 * tiers (`--motion-duration` and friends, driving Base UI's CSS enter/exit)
 * are plain durations, and pairing a CSS transition with a spring's *total*
 * duration is how the two end up visibly out of step.
 *
 * `visualDuration` overrides `duration` when both are set, so these tiers
 * deliberately carry only the one field — the other would be dead weight that
 * looks authoritative.
 *
 * ## Calm, not quick
 *
 * `fast` and `moderate` used to sit at `bounce: 0`, on the reasoning that a
 * panel which must land exactly should not overshoot. That was too literal:
 * zero bounce plus a very short duration reads as a state swap rather than a
 * transition — mechanical, with no deceleration for the eye to follow.
 *
 * The scale has been through two tuning passes since, both in the same
 * direction — every tier a little longer, a little softer. Movement that
 * registers as *comfortable* rather than merely fast wants time for its own
 * settle to be visible: `fast` at 0.24s with a 0.16 bounce eases into place
 * where 0.15s / 0.10 stopped dead. A small bounce (0.12–0.18) still has no
 * perceptible overshoot at these distances; what it buys is the organic
 * slow-down at the end. If a specific panel ever reads as unstable, take
 * *that* tier's bounce down rather than the pair of them. `snappy` is the
 * deliberate exception — it stays tight because it follows the hand.
 *
 * The `exit` durations are plain tweens (not springs — nothing needs character
 * on the way out) held at roughly 70% of their tier's entrance.
